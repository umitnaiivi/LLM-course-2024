# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
This week is focusing on practical introduction of a RAG concept: Retrieval Augmented Generation.

There are two main building blocks that you will work with:
1. [Jupyter notebook](00_simple_local_rag.ipynb)
2. [Streamlit UI](pdf_rag_ui.py), which implements the same functionality in a form of an interactive UI

# Week's tasks
You are expected to submit one task (if you like, by all means do and submit more!) from the list below.
We will discuss these tasks in class, and you can ask your questions to better understand each of them.

1. Task 1: Change the notebook or streamlit UI to support pdf documents in a language other than English: Finnish, Swedish, German etc. Things to consider:
   * Would the same embedding and LLM work for Finnish?
   * What about extracting sentences and chunking: is there any change in terms of token length / chunk size?
   * Can you assess the final quality?
2. Task 2: Research and implement alternative algorithm for chunking. For example, you can take a look at semantic chunking technique. Things to consider:
   * Does this chunker apply to any language?
   * Can you assess the quality of chunker on a handful of pages in your pdf document?
   * What is the impact on quality of the overall RAG system pipeline?
3. Task 3(*):
   * Research agentic RAG. Pick a task, like checking stock price of a company, detect the respectful intent and pull the price.
   * You can also come up with your own task / tool to use and implement that instead. 
4. Task 4(**):
   * Research GraphRAG: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI
   * Take a look at Neo4j demo: https://neo4j.com/labs/genai-ecosystem/rag-demo/
   * Come up with a KG for your domain of choice (it can be financial documents or research papers from arxiv)

# Jupyter notebook setup
Create virtual environment in this directory.

Install packages:
```
pip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]"
pip install -U torch
pip install stqdm
pip install tqdm
pip install -U sentence-transformers
pip install PyMuPDF
```
# Streamlit UI setup
