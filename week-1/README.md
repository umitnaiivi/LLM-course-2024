# Introduction to Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLM)

Week 1 is the most theory-heavy week of the course. You can find the lecture slides here: [Week 1 Slides](LLM-Course Lecture 1.pdf).

## Lab Assignment

Research on Tokenizers and write a section to your final report reflecting on the following questions:
* What are tokenizers?
* Why are they important for language modeling and LLMs?
* What different tokenization algorithms are there and which ones are the most popular ones and why?
