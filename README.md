## Course Description

This hands-on course delves into the world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Students will gain understanding of how LLMs work, how to fine-tune them for specific tasks, and how to leverage their capabilities for various NLP applications. Through weekly lectures and coding labs, students will gain practical experience working with state-of-the-art LLMs and explore their potential to revolutionize the field of NLP.

## Evaluation

The course will be evaluated based on the submission of a final report.

Students will need to submit a final report that covers all the labs:

What was done in each lab?
What was the motivation behind your solutions?
What did you learn?
Challenges you encountered?
